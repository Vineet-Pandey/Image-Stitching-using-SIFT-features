# Image-Stitching-using-SIFT-features

### Note: Works for MATLAB 2017b and higher
A MATLAB implementation for generating panoramic images has been placed in this repository. It is important that [VL Feat 0.9](http://www.vlfeat.org/install-matlab.html) be installed.
Input Images have been placed in [1](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural01.JPG),[2](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural02.JPG), [3](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural03.JPG), [4](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural04.JPG), [5](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural05.JPG), [6](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural06.JPG), [7](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural07.JPG), [8](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural08.JPG), [9](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural09.JPG), [10](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural10.JPG), [11](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural11.JPG), [12](http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/courses/CV-507/mural12.JPG)

Panoramic Images are generated by matching the SIFT features of each individual images
Following Approach has been followed to generate Panoramic Images:
Markup: 1. Mural images are placed in a folder named **Painting**.
        2. These images are pre processed to limit the width ( a std width defined by **width_lim**).
        3. First image is converted to an orthophoto using the image properties of imgCentroid, imgWidth and imgHeight for the reference to            the remaining images.
        4. Remaining images are similarly pre processed
        5. To extract the SIFT features, the following method is employed:
           * **Vlfeat** toolbox is installed and the setup is run
           * A peak and edge threshold values are chosen
           * Image SIFT features are extracted for the initial image using **vl_sift** function
           * These detected features are laid over the initial image
           * The two steps above are repeated for the next image
        6. Now, the image features and descriptors are extracted and stored for each of the images being operated upon.
        7. These descriptors are then fit with a mean of 1.5 and a confidence of 0.95 using **fitHomographyRansac** function provided
        8. Now, a homography obtained for the initial image and the next image.Now, a homography obtained for the initial image and the     next image.
        9. Images are warped using imwarp function and appended to the previous image. This process continues until all the images are stitched.
